# 🎬 Movie Ticket Booking System with Seat-Based Snack Delivery

This project is a web-based Movie Ticket Booking System developed using Flask.  
Users can book movie tickets and, **only during ticket booking**, they can also order snacks which will be delivered directly to their selected seat.

## 📌 Project Overview

The application ensures that snack booking is strictly tied to movie ticket booking.  
Once a user selects a movie and seat, snack options become available. After confirmation, the booking details show that snacks will be delivered to the user's seat inside the theater.
